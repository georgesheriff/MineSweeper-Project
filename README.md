# MineSweeper-Project
The AI module for a minesweeper robot created for the CSEN403 course at the GUC. The environment in which the robot operates is any grid of cells of any size. Initially, a cell on the grid is either empty, contains the robot, or contains a mine. The robot can move in all four directions and is able to collect a mine only if it is in the same cell as the mine. The program will take as input the initial position of the robot and the positions of all of the mines. The objective of the AI module is to compute a sequence of actions that the robot can follow in order to go to all the mines and collect them. (Done By: Haskell)
